# To-Do-List-Manager

The procedure of building a To-Do list management application using Tkinter is divided into several steps.

These steps are shown below:

Step 1: First, we will import all the modules required to build the project.
Step 2: We will then define some functions necessary to execute the application.
Step 3: We will then create a main window for the application.
Step 4: We will then add a database to the application to store the data.
Step 5: We will add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.
Step 6: Calling the functions in the main function of the application.

Before we start building our projects, it is important to import the modules necessary for the working of the application. We will import all the required widgets and modules from the Tkinter library to provide the Graphical User Interface touch to the application. We will also import the sqlite3 module to store the data in a database.





--In the below code snippet, we have imported the tkinter module as tk. We then imported the ttk module and the messagebox from the Tkinter library. At last, we have imported the sqlite3 module as sql:

import tkinter as tk 
from tkinter import ttk 
from tkinter import messagebox 
import sqlite3 as sql
